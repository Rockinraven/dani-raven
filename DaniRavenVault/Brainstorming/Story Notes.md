- excavation of hob's barrow
- want concrete start to end story rather than endless like Stardew
- quest-y/introspective spooky fantasy
- mystery (maybe murder mystery?)
- some kind of beast in the town
- no one knows what it is, trying to hunt it down and kill it
- want to include battles
- a little grind-y resource collection
	- limited amount of stuff you can do in the day
	- need to prioritize bc can't do everything
- too open world gets overwhelming
