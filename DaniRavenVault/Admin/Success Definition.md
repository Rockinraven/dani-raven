*What will make you feel like "we did it!" at the end?*
## Raven

- have fun :)
- Setting a realistic amount of time where we will be working on this, and sticking to it
- World has at least:
	- one finished map
	- 3 NPC characters
		- with interactions and associated story/cause and effect
	- 2 integrated "mechanisms" (ex: health and battles, magic spells, etc)
- Stretch Goals
	- small, contained DEMO that feels "playable and complete", so we could show friends and have them playtest
		- "playable and complete" means:
			- has a defined start and end (from a story perspective)
			- takes 10-20 mins to play through (at a normal first-time pace)
			- few bugs or missing interactions

## Dani
- timeline good, probs 2-3 months
- 3 characters with full stories behind them
- like the stretch goals
## How do we achieve this?
- structure?
- roles?
- commitment?

# mood/tone
- Dani needs a bit of business to stay on track
	- having soft goals throughout
	- not deadlines
	- [ ] dani to think more
	- raven to give list of concrete things that are needed to advance game dev
		- allows space for more nebulous thought about like, worldbuilding while also keeping dev work on track
- schedule
	- 3 months
	- weekly async check-in
	- bi-monthly 15 min irl chat
	- **monthly big meeting for progress and review**
		- sundays and tuesdays no work, probs **sundays** will work best
