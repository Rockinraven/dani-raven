*What will make you feel like "we did it!" at the end?*
## Raven

- Setting a realistic amount of time where we will be working on this, and sticking to it
- World has at least:
	- one finished map
	- 3 NPC characters
		- with interactions and associated story/cause and effect
	- 2 integrated "mechanisms" (ex: health and battles, magic spells, etc)
- Stretch Goals
	- small, contained DEMO that feels "playable and complete", so we could show friends and have them playtest
		- "playable and complete" means:
			- has a defined start and end (from a story perspective)
			- takes 10-20 mins to play through (at a normal first-time pace)
			- few bugs or missing interactions

## How do we achieve this?
- structure?
- roles?
- commitment?
